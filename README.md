# Astronomics Manufacturing Calculator

This is a handy tool for [Astronomics](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1975520/Astronomics/).

Enter what you want to craft, and it will calculate where to gather the raw materials, which machines to use, and how many of each item you need.


This application was created with $30 worth of Anthropic credits with Claude Code lol
